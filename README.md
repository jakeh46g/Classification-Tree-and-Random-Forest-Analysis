# Classification-Tree-and-Random-Forest-Analysis
### These two supervised learning projects allowed me to gain an understanding of how decision tree and random forest models make classification predictions. The data used for these models are outlined below.

## Salmons.csv
### Salmons Stores operates a national chain of women’s apparel stores. Five thousand copies of an expensive four-color sales catalog have been printed, and each catalog includes a coupon that provides a $50 discount on purchases of $200 or more. Salmons would like to send the catalogs only to customers who have the highest probability of using the coupon. The file Salmons contains data from an earlier promotional campaign. For each of 1,000 Salmons customers, three variables are tracked: last year’s total spending at Salmons (Spending), whether they have a Salmons store credit card (Card), and whether they used the promotional coupon they were sent (Coupon).

## cellphonechurn.csv
### Telecommunications companies providing cell-phone service are interested in customer retention. In particular, identifying customers who are about to churn (cancel their service) is potentially worth millions of dollars if the company can proactively address the reason that customer is considering cancellation and retain the customer. Data on past customers, some of whom churned and some who did not, have been collected.
